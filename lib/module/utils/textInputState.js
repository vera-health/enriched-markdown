/**
 * Bridges EnrichedMarkdownTextInput into React Native's TextInputState focus
 * registry so it participates in RN's keyboard-dismiss behavior (issue #577).
 *
 * Registering a non-TextInput host component is safe: TextInputState's
 * blurTextInput dispatches the built-in TextInput's "blur" command at the
 * registered instance, and Fabric command dispatch is name-based — it works
 * as long as the component ships a command with that name, which ours does.
 *
 * A deep import is required because the public TextInput.State API lacks the
 * registerInput/focusInput/blurInput bookkeeping functions.

/**
 * The internal module's export shape has changed across RN versions: newer
 * versions use `export default` (surfacing as `.default` after Metro's CJS
 * transform) while older ones assigned `module.exports` directly. A raw
 * require bypasses Babel's import interop, so both shapes are handled here.
