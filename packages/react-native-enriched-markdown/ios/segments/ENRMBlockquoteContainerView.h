/**
 * A GFM blockquote rendered as a recursive container (issue #608): it splits its
 * own AST children into segments and lays them out through the shared
 * ENRMContainerNodeView machinery, so a nested quote becomes another
 * ENRMBlockquoteContainerView, a fenced code block becomes an
 * ENRMCodeBlockContainerView, and prose collapses into a single inner text view.
 * Nesting depth is automatic: each level is its own view, inset further by its
 * padding, so drawRect: only ever renders one accent bar plus the background for
 * this single level. This mirrors Android's BlockquoteContainerView.
 *
 * The content inset is applied via contentInsets (left = borderWidth + gapWidth
 * + padding, other edges = padding), reusing the geometry the commonmark
 * BlockquoteBorder draws for the in-text (list-nested) path, which stays
 * untouched. The base measure/layout already honor contentInsets.
 *
 * Streaming is static inside a quote (no pending fence, no animation); a content
 * change re-signs the whole subtree so the outer reconciler still reuses the
 * quote view.
