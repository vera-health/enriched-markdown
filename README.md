## Prerequisites

**Native (iOS / Android / macOS)**

- Requires [the React Native New Architecture (Fabric)](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page)
- See [Compatibility Table](#compatibility-table) for supported React Native versions
- macOS support via [react-native-macos](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos) `0.81+`

**Web**

- Requires [`react-native-web`](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) and Metro (or another bundler with `.web.tsx` platform resolution)
- No New Architecture requirement — the web renderer runs entirely in JavaScript via WebAssembly
- Only `EnrichedMarkdownText` is supported on web (`EnrichedMarkdownTextInput` is native-only)
- LaTeX math requires the optional [`katex`](https://katex.org/) peer dependency

## Installation

### Web

No steps beyond having `react-native-web` configured. For LaTeX math, install the optional peer dependency:

```sh
npm install katex
# or
yarn add katex
```

See [Web Support](../../docs/WEB.md) for full setup details, supported features, and prop behaviour.

### Bare React Native app (iOS / Android)

#### 1. Install the library

```sh
yarn add react-native-enriched-markdown
```

> [!TIP]
> To try the latest features before they land in a stable release, install the nightly build:
>
> ```sh
> yarn add react-native-enriched-markdown@nightly
> ```
>
> Nightly versions are published to npm automatically and may contain breaking changes.

> [!NOTE]
> On install, a `postinstall` script downloads the large native assets used by code highlighting
> and iOS LaTeX math (kept out of the npm tarball to keep it ~1 MB). This needs network access to
> `registry.npmjs.org` and `github.com`. If you install offline, with `--ignore-scripts`, or with
> **pnpm** (which blocks dependency scripts by default), see
> [Native assets](../../docs/NATIVE_ASSETS.md) for how to restore them.

#### Configuration

Add an `"enriched-markdown"` block to your app's `package.json` to configure which features are enabled:

```json
{
  "enriched-markdown": {
    "enableCodeHighlight": true,
    "enableMath": true,
    "codeHighlightLanguages": ["javascript", "typescript", "python", "swift", "kotlin"]
  }
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enableCodeHighlight` | `boolean` | `true` | Download and compile tree-sitter grammars for syntax highlighting |
| `enableMath` | `boolean` | `true` | Download RaTeX for LaTeX math rendering (iOS) and include the Maven dependency (Android) |
| `codeHighlightLanguages` | `string[]` | all default grammars | Subset of languages to compile (reduces binary size). Ignored when `enableCodeHighlight` is `false`; an empty array `[]` compiles none (same as disabling). |

Your app's `package.json` is the single source of truth. `postinstall` reads it to decide
what to **download** into `node_modules`, and the native build (iOS podspec / Android
`build.gradle`) reads it directly to decide what to **compile and link** — no Podfile ENV
vars or `gradle.properties` edits needed. Changing a value takes effect on your next
`pod install` / native rebuild; **enabling** a feature that was off also needs a reinstall
(`npm install` / `npm rebuild react-native-enriched-markdown`) so its assets get downloaded.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **iOS applies config at `pod install`, not at build time.** After editing the `enriched-markdown`
> block, run `pod install` (a plain `run-ios` reuses the previously resolved pod). When **disabling** a
> feature that was already compiled in — or narrowing `codeHighlightLanguages` — also do a clean build
> (`Product > Clean Build Folder`), since Xcode's incremental build can link a stale pod library.
> Android reconfigures on every build and needs neither step.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't use a feature, disabling it skips the download **and** excludes it from the native build.
> See [Skipping the download](../../docs/NATIVE_ASSETS.md#skipping-the-download-opt-out) for details.

> [!NOTE]
> **Monorepos:** the native build reads the **app's** `package.json` (the one next to
> `ios/`/`android/`), so each app can enable/disable features independently. The download
> opt-out is resolved where you run the install — usually the workspace root — so to skip a
> download entirely, put the opt-out in the **root** `package.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> Migrating from the Expo config plugin or the `ENV` / `gradle.properties` build flags? See
> [Breaking changes](../../docs/BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

#### 2. Install iOS / macOS dependencies

The library includes native code so you will need to re-build the native app.

```sh
# iOS
cd ios && bundle install && bundle exec pod install

# macOS (react-native-macos)
cd macos && bundle install && bundle exec pod install
```

### Expo app

#### 1. Install the library

```sh
npx expo install react-native-enriched-markdown
```

#### 2. Run prebuild

The library includes native code so you will need to re-build the native app.

```sh
npx expo prebuild
```

> [!NOTE]
> The library won't work in Expo Go as it needs native changes.

> [!NOTE]
> `npx expo install` runs the same `postinstall` asset download described under
> [Native assets](../../docs/NATIVE_ASSETS.md); it needs network access and does not work with Yarn PnP.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **iOS: Save to Camera Roll**
>
> If your Markdown content includes images and you want users to save them to their photo library, add the following to your `Info.plist`:
>
> ```xml
> <key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
> <string>This app needs access to your photo library to save images.</string>
> ```

## macOS Support

`react-native-enriched-markdown` supports macOS via [react-native-macos](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos). See [macOS Support](../../docs/MACOS.md) for details on macOS-specific features, known limitations, and the example app.

## Future Plans

We're actively working on expanding the capabilities of `react-native-enriched-markdown`. Here's what's on the roadmap:

- `EnrichedMarkdownTextInput`: headings, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, inline images
- `EnrichedMarkdownTextInput` web support
- macOS: block math rendering, VoiceOver accessibility, tail fade-in animation
- Web: spoiler text, streaming animation, configurable link `target`, copy options (Copy as Markdown, multi-format clipboard)
